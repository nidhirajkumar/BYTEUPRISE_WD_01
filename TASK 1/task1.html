                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>JAVA/DBMS Project</p>
                <p>The Library Management System (LMS) is a Java-based application designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a library. The system allows librarians to maintain records of books, manage users, and facilitate efficient book borrowing and returning. It ensures that the catalog of books is up-to-date, tracks the availability of books, and stores information about members. The system is backed by a DBMS (Database Management System) to handle data storage and retrieval efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>Electronics Thermometer Using Op-Amp 741</p>
                <p>The Electronics Thermometer is a simple analog temperature measurement system that uses an operational amplifier (Op-Amp 741) as the core component. The system is designed to convert temperature variations into corresponding voltage signals, which are displayed on a voltmeter or calibrated scale. The Op-Amp 741 amplifies the voltage output from a temperature sensor such as a thermistor or diode, allowing for precise temperature readings. This project showcases the use of analog electronics to create a cost-effective and efficient temperature-sensing device.</p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>Clothing Website Development</p>
                <p>The Clothing Website is a dynamic e-commerce platform designed for showcasing and selling clothing items online. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, providing an interactive user experience and server-side functionality. It allows users to browse through various clothing categories, view detailed product information, and make purchases. The backend, powered by PHP, handles product management, user authentication, and order processing, while the frontend ensures an intuitive and responsive interface.</p>
